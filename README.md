# Data Visualization Pharma

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a pharmaceutical dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor volumes in mice. Through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, insights are derived about the best-performing drugs and their impact on tumor growth.

The study is part of a broader effort to understand and visualize pharmaceutical data for better decision-making in drug development and treatment optimization.
